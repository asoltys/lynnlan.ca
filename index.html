    <h1>Welcome to Lynn LAN!
    <h2>Lynn Valley's Local Area Network</h2>
    <p>
    Lynn LAN is an open network operated by <a href="https://adamsoltys.com">Adam Soltys</a> that anyone in North Vancouver's Lynn Valley can join to receive discount high-speed Internet service. The backhaul connection is a 1Gbps (gigabit per second) fibre connection provided by Telus at Adam's home.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>

    <p>$20 CAD/month + monthly data charges</p>
    <p>Data rate: $0.10/GB upload/download</p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>

    <p>100-500Mbps</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <p>A household wanting to join the network can connect to another household that's already on the network, either by running a direct cable if they're on an adjacent property, or by using an outdoor WiFi antenna to establish a wireless link, like the old game of telephone with tin cans and string going from house to house.</p>

    <p>The cable or wireless signal from your neighbour's place will be plugged into a router in your home via ethernet cable. The router creates a hotspot/access point that your devices can connect to via WiFi or ethernet.</p>
   
    <p>The service can work alongside your existing service as a completely separate hotspot so you can keep your current plan and try things out with no strings attached.</p>
