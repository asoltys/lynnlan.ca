    <h2>Pricing</h2>

    <p>$20 CAD/month + monthly data charges</p>
    <p>Data rate: $0.10/GB unlimited upload/download</p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>

    <p>80-500 Mbps depending on equipment and link distance</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <p>
      I have a 1 gigabit per second Telus Pure Fibre business connection that
      I'm willing to share with any household that wants to connect to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can connect either by running a direct cable if you're on an adjacent
      property, or by using an outdoor WiFi antenna to establish a wireless link
      so long as there's a direct line of sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      As more households join the network, you may be able to connect to them as
      well if they're willing to act as a relay by forwarding my connection or
      as a gateway by sharing their own high speed connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The antenna or cable connecting to your neighbour plugs into a router in
      your home. The router creates a hotspot access point that your devices can
      connect to over WiFi or ethernet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The service can work alongside your existing service as a completely
      separate hotspot so you can keep your current plan and try things out with
      no strings attached.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open source software from <a href="https://althea.net">Althea</a> runs on
      the routers and takes care of splitting the connection efficiently,
      keeping track of how much bandwidth is being used, managing billing, and
      securing the network through encrypted VPN tunnels.
    </p>

    <h3>1x Outdoor Ethernet Cable</h3>

      I have a 1000ft spool of cable so I can provide this and cut it to length
      for people as needed.

    <h2>Payment</h2>

    <p>
      Each month, my router will produce a report of how much bandwidth was
      consumed by all the routers connected to it. I'll send out an email
      invoice to each subscriber with a report of their bandwidth usage, asking
      for payment of $20 plus $0.10/GB for every GB of bandwidth used. The
      average Canadian household uses 100GB of data in a month. You can check
      with your provider to find out your monthly usage. Payment can be sent by:

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <b>Is this legal?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, the wireless antennas transmit over the unlicensed WiFi spectrum at
      either 5Ghz or 60Ghz at power levels well within local regulatory limits.
      I've confirmed with Telus in writing that I won't be violating their terms
      of service by sharing or re-selling my connection because I'm paying for a
      business account.
    </p>

    <b>Is this cool?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, extremely cool. By participating, you'll be building a resilient
      communications network that can have multiple redundant paths to the
      Internet and continue to operate in emergency situations. Households on
      the network can continue to host services, share files, and communicate
      with each other even if the wider Internet were to become unavailable.
      There's a potential to connect up with similar networks in other
      neighbourhoods, forming a kind of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">meshnet</a>.
    </p>

    <b
      >What about privacy/security? Can my neighbours snoop on my data or see
      what sites I'm visiting?</b
    >
    <p>
      No, all the connections are routed through an unlogged
      <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">VPN</a> server before being sent on
      to the Internet. For a few dollars per month you can use an additional 3rd
      party VPN like <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">Nord</a> or
      <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">PIA</a>. I'd be happy to
      help anyone who wants to know more.
    </p>

    <b>Can I hook up my neighbours?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, if you want to act as a relay in the network you can set up a link
      between more than one neighbour or sell the connection to your neighbours.
      The software included on your router will keep track of how much bandwidth
      they use and you can charge them whatever you like for it. I might offer a discounted
      data rate to households that relay my connection.
    </p>

    <b
      >Is the service going to be stable and reliable? Can I call you in the
      middle of the night if things go wrong?</b
    >
    <p>
      I'll do my best to make sure the network is always online but to be honest
      I've never done anything quite like this before and until I get a few
      people online and trying it out I can't say with confidence that there
      won't be a few growing pains and hiccups. This isn't a full-time business
      venture for me but more of a hobby project that might turn into a side gig
      that might turn into a business one day if things go well. I can't make
      any guarantees about uptime or my own personal availability at this point
      so if losing Internet for a few hours due to unexpected outages is going
      to be a deal-breaker for you, I'd suggest staying with your current
      provider for a while until the network gets built out a bit more and
      there are more households than just mine acting as gateways to the Internet.
    </p>

    <b>What else is cool about decentralized community meshnets?</b>
    <p>
      The equipment for making connections is owned and operated by the people
      in the neighbourhood who are using the network rather than a big
      corporation so they can switch providers or upgrade their service really
      easily. For instance, if I were to start price gouging or overselling my
      connection, anyone on the network could offer to be a gateway node and get
      their own resellable connection from Telus or another provider that they
      could offer to everyone on the network for a cheaper rate. The software on
      everyone's routers will automatically find and use the cheapest/fastest route to
      the Internet if there are multiple options.
    </p>

    <b>How many people can join?</b>
    <p>
      I think my current 1Gbps connection should be capable of comfortably
      servicing about 40 households but at this point I'd be happy to start slow
      and experiment with just a few brave customers for a while.
    </p>

    <b
      >Can I get out of my current contract or bundle and switch to this
      instead?</b
    >
    <p>
      Yes, your provider may charge a cancellation fee, something like $10/month
      for each month remaining on your contract. You'll probably save more than
      that by switching though.
