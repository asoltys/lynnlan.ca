    <h1>Welcome to Lynn LAN!</h1>
    <h2>Lynn Valley's Local Area Network</h2>
    <p>
      Lynn LAN is a neighbourhood network in North Vancouver, British Columbia,
      that anyone can join to receive discount high-speed Internet service.
    </p>

    <img src="lynn.png" alt="Lynn Valley" style="max-width: 100%;" />

    <h2>Pricing</h2>

    <p>$20 CAD/month flat rate + monthly data charges</p>
    <p>Data rates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First 100GB (up/down): $0.10/GB</li>
      <li>Additional unlimited usage (up/down): $0.05/GB</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      An average Canadian household uses about 100GB in a month so
      they'd pay $30/mo. Someone using 200GB would pay $35/mo. You can check with your
      current provider to find out your typical usage if you're not sure
      what it is.
    </p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>

    <p>150-900 Mbps, depending which antennas we use</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://adamsoltys.com">Adam</a> has a
      1Gbps business fibre Internet connection from Telus that 
      anyone in the neighbourhood can use.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can connect the service to your household either by running a direct cable, if you're close enough,
      or more likely by using an outdoor WiFi antenna to establish a wireless link,
      so long as there's direct line of sight with not too many trees or other houses in the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      A cable coming from the antenna outside your home will have to be run inside where it'll plug into a standard WiFi router. The
      router creates a WiFi hotspot or access point that your devices can connect to.
    </p>

    <p>
      The router runs custom software from
      <a href="https://althea.net">Althea</a> (which I helped build!) that takes care of sharing the
      connection efficiently when we're both trying to use it, keeping track of
      bandwidth usage, and encrypting all the traffic to protect your
      privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The service can work alongside your existing service as a 
      separate hotspot so you can keep your current plan and try things out with
      no strings attached.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <b>Is this legal?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, perfectly legal, and I've confirmed with Telus in writing that I won't be violating their terms
      of service by sharing or selling the connection because it's a business connection that I pay extra for.
    </p>

    <b>Is it safe?</b>
    <p>
    Yes, the wireless antennas used to connect households are designed to operate well within regulatory limits on power output and are designed to operate over the public, unlicensed WiFi spectrum that everyone uses for their home connections already.
    </p>

    <b>Is it worth it?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, besides getting much cheaper and faster Internet, you'll also be building a
      resilient network that will keep you and your community connected in the event of Internet disruption or emergency situations. Households on the network can
      continue to host services, share files, and communicate with each other
      even if the wider Internet were to become unavailable. There's potential to eventually
      connect up with similar networks in other neighbourhoods and towns, forming a kind
      of broader
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">meshnet</a>.
    </p>

    <b
      >What about privacy and security? Can my neighbours snoop on my data or see
      what sites I'm visiting?</b
    >
    <p>
      No, all traffic is encrypted and routed to an unlogged remote
      <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">VPN</a> server using <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> before being sent off 
      to the Internet, so neither your neighbours or even Telus can spy on it.
    </p>

    <b
      >Can you help me install the antenna and router at my house and help with
      any other setup and configuration or troubleshooting?</b
    >
    <p>You betcha</p>

    <b>Can I hook up my neighbours?</b>
    <p>
      Yes, once you have service from me, other people can connect to you and you can forward the service to them. You can even earn money for being a relay.
    </p>

    <b
      >Is the service going to be stable and reliable? Who do I call if things
      aren't working?</b
    >
    <p>
      I haven't experienced a single outage from Telus since signing up for their fibre service in 2018. If there are issues though, they have a 24/7 tech support line for business accounts that I'll call right away. If the issue isn't with the upstream Telus connection to my place but with the connection between us, I'll be on call to troubleshoot. I have software in place to notify me immediately if things go wrong. Trust me, I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-soltys-891b5520/">professional</a>!</p>

    <b>Who pays for the equipment?</b>
    <p>
      I have three pairs of high quality antennas and routers I'm willing to lend out for free to
      the first few people who sign up. After that, new subscribers will be responsible for purchasing their own equipment. I can provide advice and help with installation.
    </p>
      
    <b>How many people can join?</b>
    <p>
      The 1Gbps fibre connection we have currently should comfortably service about 50
      subscribers. Before getting even close to that many though, I would consider getting another
      dedicated connection from Shaw or Telus at another household to provide more capacity and redundancy.
    </p>

    <b
      >Can I get out of my current contract or bundle and switch to this
      instead?</b
    >
    <p>
      Sure, if you want to drop your
      current plan, your provider may charge a cancellation fee if you're on a
      contract, something like $10/month for each remaining month. I expect the savings you'd see from switching would more than make up for that cancellation cost.

      update this page with more information as the
      network gets going.
